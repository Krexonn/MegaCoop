# MegaCoop - Multiplayer C++ Core

This repository contains the **C++ source code and gameplay logic** for *MegaCoop*, a multiplayer game project developed in Unreal Engine 5.

⚠️ **Note:** To keep the repository size manageable for code review, the **Content** folder (assets, maps, blueprints) is excluded. This repo is intended to demonstrate C++ architecture, replication logic, and coding standards.

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### Core Systems (C++)
* **Network Replication:** Server-authoritative logic for game state and player actions.
* **Custom Character Class:** Extended `ACharacter` with custom movement and interaction capabilities.
* **Game Mode Logic:** Rulesets for multiplayer sessions and match flow control.

### Architecture
* **Modular Design:** Code is separated into logical components for reusability.
* **Clean Code:** Follows Unreal Engine coding standards and naming conventions.

## 📂 Directory Structure
* `/Source` - Contains all C++ classes (.h and .cpp files).
* `/Config` - Project configuration and input mappings.
